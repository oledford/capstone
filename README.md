# Remarque Frontend

This project is a React frontend for a note-taking application.  Running it requires running [Remarque-API](https://github.com/noahpanicola/Remarque-API) and having the PostgreSQL database assigned set up correctly.

## Scripts

In the project director, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
